# üì∏ Audit Logging Implementation - Proof of Execution
This document contains **screenshots** of SQL query outputs to **demonstrate** the correct working of the **Audit Logging feature**.

-------------------------------------
## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Checking the Audit Log Table (Before Action)
This query retrieves the audit log entries before any job actions have occurred.

```
SELECT * FROM pgagent.pga_job_audit_log;
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
The audit log table should be empty before any actions are performed.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Performing Job Actions
Perform job actions like creating, modifying, or deleting a job. For example, create a new job.


```
SELECT * FROM pgagent.pga_job_audit_log;
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
An entry should be added to the audit log table with event_type = CREATE.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Audit Log for Job Action
Verifying that the correct action is logged after the job creation.

```
SELECT * FROM pgagent.pga_job_audit_log WHERE operation_type = 'CREATE';
```
‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
The log entry should contain the job ID, event type (CREATE), timestamp, and user who performed the action.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Job Modification
Modify an existing job.

‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
An entry should be added to the audit log table with event_type = MODIFY.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Job Deletion
Delete an existing job.


‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
An entry should be added to the audit log table with event_type = DELETE.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Job Execution
Trigger a job execution (e.g., a manual run).


‚úÖ **Expected Output**:
An entry should be added to the audit log table with event_type = EXECUTE.

## **üéØ Conclusion:
The Audit Logging feature is working as expected, accurately logging job actions such as creation, modification, deletion, and execution.
